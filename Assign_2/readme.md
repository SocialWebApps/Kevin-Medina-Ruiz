This is my assignment 2.

My actual notebook was too big to copy over, therefore, I took out my credentials and made the ouput fail. This way the file was smaller since there was no actual tweet data in the output of the notebook.

Update: on 03/15/2015

I figured out how to clear the output of ipythin notebooks. So I did that to minimize the size of the .ipynb file. This should make it a faster download for whoever is using this notebook. The original file with my output is still in the old repo if needed.
